# GDS Course

This repo contains the [Geographic Data Science course](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/home.html) by [Dani Arribas-Bel](https://github.com/darribas).

## Taking the course
I'm taking the course on my own, at my own pace, without actually submitting any of the assignments. My solutions to the tasks will be uploaded to the [Hand-Ins](https://github.com/MarcosDemetry/GDS-Course/tree/main/Hand-Ins) folder.
