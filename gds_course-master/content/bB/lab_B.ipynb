    "\n",
    "Real world datasets are messy. There is no way around it: datasets have \"holes\" (missing data), the amount of formats in which data can be stored is endless, and the best structure to share data is not always the optimum to analyze them, hence the need to [munge](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/munge) them. As has been correctly pointed out in many outlets ([e.g.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0)), much of the time [spent](https://twitter.com/BigDataBorat/status/306596352991830016) in what is called (Geo-)Data Science is related not only to sophisticated modeling and insight, but has to do with much more basic and less exotic tasks such as obtaining data, processing, turning them into a shape that makes analysis possible, and exploring it to get to know their basic properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "For how labor intensive and relevant this aspect is, there is surprisingly very little published on patterns, techniques, and best practices for quick and efficient data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. In this session, you will use a few real world datasets and learn how to process them into Python so they can be transformed and manipulated, if necessary, and analyzed. For this, we will introduce some of the bread and butter of data analysis and scientific computing in Python. These are fundamental tools that are constantly used in almost any task relating to data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the basic and the content that is expected to be learnt by every student. We use a prepared dataset that saves us much of the more intricate processing that goes beyond the introductory level the session is aimed at. As a companion to this introduction, there is an additional notebook (see link on the website page for Lab 01) that covers how the dataset used here was prepared from raw data downloaded from the internet, and includes some additional exercises you can do if you want dig deeper into the content of this lab.\n",

    "Note the printing is cut to keep a nice and compact view, but enough to see its structure. Since they represent a table of data, `DataFrame` objects have two dimensions: rows and columns. Each of these is automatically assigned a name in what we will call its *index*. When printing, the index of each dimension is rendered in bold, as opposed to the standard rendering for the content. In the example above, we can see how the column index is automatically picked up from the `.csv` file's column names. For rows, we have specified when reading the file we wanted the column `GeographyCode`, so that is used. If we hadn't specified any, `pandas` will automatically generate a sequence starting in `0` and going all the way to the number of rows minus one. This is the standard structure of a `DataFrame` object, so we will come to it over and over. Importantly, even when we move to spatial data, our datasets will have a similar structure.\n",

    "Once you can read your data in, explore specific cases, and have a first visual approach to the entire set, the next step can be preparing it for more sophisticated analysis. Maybe you are thinking of modeling it through regression, or on creating subgroups in the dataset with particular characteristics, or maybe you simply need to present summary measures that relate to a slightly different arrangement of the data than you have been presented with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these cases, you first need what statistician, and general R wizard, Hadley Wickham calls *\"tidy data\"*. The general idea to \"tidy\" your data is to convert them from whatever structure they were handed in to you into one that allows convenient and standardized manipulation, and that supports directly inputting the data into what he calls \"*tidy*\" analysis tools. But, at a more practical level, what is exactly *\"tidy data\"*? In Wickham's own words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is\n",
    "messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations,\n",
    "variables and types.*\n",
    "\n",
    "He then goes on to list the three fundamental characteristics of *\"tidy data\"*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each variable forms a column.\n",
    "1. Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are further interested in the concept of *\"tidy data\"*, I recommend you check out the [original paper](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/) (open access) and the [public repository](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data) associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us bring in the concept of \"*tidy data*\" to our own Liverpool dataset. First, remember its structure:"
