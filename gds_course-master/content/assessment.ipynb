    "Here's the premise. You will take the role of a real-world data scientist tasked to explore a dataset on the city of Toronto (Canada) and find useful insights for a variety of decision-makers. It does not matter if you have never been to Toronto. In fact, this will help you focus on what you can learn about the city *through* the data, without the influence of prior knowledge. Furthermore, the assessment will *not* be marked based on how much you know about Toronto but instead about how much you can show you have learned through analysing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and computational results that are included in the essay itself. This piece of assessment is *equivalent* to 2,500 words. However, this is the overall weight. Since you will need to create not only English narrative but also code and figures, here are the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum of 750 words (bibliography, if included, does *not* contribute to the word count)\n",
    "- Up to three maps or figures (a figure may include more than one map and will only count as one but needs to be integrated in the same `matplotlib` figure)\n",
    "- Up to one table\n",

    "\n",
    "> [`https://open.toronto.ca/`](https://open.toronto.ca/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part I - Common\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the one everyone has to do in the same way. Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select two variables from the socio-economic dataset \n",
    "2. Explore the spatial distribution of the data using choropleths. Comment on the details of your maps and interpret the results \n",
    "3. Explore the degree of spatial autocorrelation. Describe the concepts behind your approach and interpret your results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part II - Choose your own adventure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this one, you need to pick *one* of the following three options. Only one, and make the most of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a geodemographic classification and interpret the results. In the process, answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - What are the main types of neighborhoods you identify? \n",
    "    - Which characteristics help you delineate this typology? \n",
    "    - If you had to use this classification to target areas in most need, how would you use it? why? \n",

    "2. Create a regionalisation and interpret the results. In the process, answer at least the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - How is the city partitioned by your data? \n",
    "    - What do you learn about the geography of the city from the regionalisation? \n",
    "    - What would one useful application of this regionalisation in the context of urban policy? \n",

    "3. Using the photographs, complete the following tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visualise the dataset appropriately and discuss why you have taken your specific approach \n",
    "    - Use DBSCAN to identify areas of the city with high density of photographs, which we will call areas of interest (AOI). In completing this, answer the following questions: \n",
    "        - What parameters have you used to run DBSCAN? Why? \n",
    "        - What do the clusters help you learn about areas of interest in the city? \n",
    "        - Name one example of how these AOIs can be of use for the city. You can take the perspective of an urban planner, a policy maker, an operational practitioner (e.g. police, trash collection), an urban entrepreneur, or any other role you envision.\n",

    "* **0-15**: the code does not run and there is no documentation to follow it.\n",

    "* **40-49**: the code runs and produces the expected output.  There is some documentation explaining its logic.\n",
    "* **50-59**: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation explaining its logic.\n",
    "* **60-69**: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive documentation, properly formatted, explaining its logic.\n",
    "* **70-79**: all as above, plus the code design includes clear evidence of skills presented in advanced sections of the course (e.g. custom methods, list comprehensions, etc.).\n",
    "* **80-100**: all as above, plus the code contains novel contributions that extend/improve the functionality the student was provided with (e.g. algorithm optimizations, novel methods to perform the task, etc.)."
